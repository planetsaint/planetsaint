**Network Engineer by day | Cybersecurity Developer by night -
I love Red Teaming**

I specialize in developing security tools, system hardening, and creating applications that operate at the intersection of performance and stealth. My work focuses on cybersecurity research, defensive tools, and low-level system manipulation with an emphasis on operational security.

## What I Work On

**Cybersecurity Tools & Research**
- Advanced encryption implementations and cryptographic tools
- Stealth applications and evasion techniques
- System forensics and security analysis

**Defensive Security**
- System hardening and boot-time security optimization
- Secure file handling and data protection
- Performance-focused security implementations

**Red Team Development**
- Custom payload development and delivery mechanisms
- Anti-detection techniques and operational security
- Cross-platform security testing tools

**Languages:** C++, Shell/Bash, Assembly  
**Systems:** Linux, Windows  
**Specialties:** Cryptography, Stealth techniques, Memory manipulation, Anti-detection, OPSEC  
**Security Focus:** Penetration testing, Malware analysis, System exploitation, Digital forensics

## Featured Projects

### [Secure File Encryption](https://github.com/planetsaint/secure-file-encryption) 
High-performance, multi-threaded AES-256-CBC encryption tool for Windows. Built with operational security in mind, featuring secure memory handling and anti-forensic capabilities.
Supports payload injection and obfuscation techniques.

### [Windows Background App](https://github.com/planetsaint/windows-background-app)
Stealth Windows application with advanced evasion capabilities. Demonstrates sophisticated techniques for maintaining persistence while avoiding detection through shelter injection and system-level programming.
