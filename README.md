# Hey there! I'm saint

**Network Engineer by day | Cybersecurity Developer by night -
I love Red Teaming**

I specialize in developing security tools, system hardening, and creating applications that operate at the intersection of performance and stealth. My work focuses on cybersecurity research, defensive tools, and low-level system manipulation with an emphasis on operational security.

## What I Work On

**Cybersecurity Tools & Research**
- Advanced encryption implementations and cryptographic tools
- Stealth applications and evasion techniques
- System forensics and security analysis

**Defensive Security**
- System hardening and boot-time security optimization
- Secure file handling and data protection
- Performance-focused security implementations

**Red Team Development**
- Custom payload development and delivery mechanisms
- Anti-detection techniques and operational security
- Cross-platform security testing tools

## Tech Stack

**Languages:** C++, Shell/Bash, Assembly  
**Systems:** Linux, Windows  
**Specialties:** Cryptography, Stealth techniques, Memory manipulation, Anti-detection, OPSEC  
**Security Focus:** Penetration testing, Malware analysis, System exploitation, Digital forensics

## Featured Projects

### [Linux Startup Optimizer](https://github.com/planetsaint/linux-startup-optimizer)
Security-focused boot optimization tool with rollback functionality. Designed for hardening Linux systems while maintaining performance and providing forensic-safe rollback capabilities.

### [Secure File Encryption](https://github.com/planetsaint/secure-file-encryption) 
High-performance, multi-threaded AES-256-CBC encryption tool for Windows. Built with operational security in mind, featuring secure memory handling and anti-forensic capabilities.
Supports payload injection and obfuscation techniques.

### [Windows Background App](https://github.com/planetsaint/windows-background-app)
Stealth Windows application with advanced evasion capabilities. Demonstrates sophisticated techniques for maintaining persistence while avoiding detection through shelter injection and system-level programming.

## Philosophy

I believe in building tools that prioritize both security and operational effectiveness. Whether developing defensive security measures or researching offensive capabilities, my focus is on creating robust, undetectable solutions that push the boundaries of what's possible in cybersecurity.
